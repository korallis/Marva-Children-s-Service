# MUVE Children's Services Website Project Brief

## Executive Summary

MUVE Children's Services requires a modern, professional WordPress website that effectively communicates their specialized pediatric care services while maintaining a playful, approachable design that resonates with families. The website will serve as the primary digital touchpoint for parents, caregivers, and healthcare professionals seeking specialized children's services.

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
MUVE Children's Services currently lacks a comprehensive digital presence to effectively communicate their specialized pediatric care offerings, making it difficult for families in need to discover and access their services.
