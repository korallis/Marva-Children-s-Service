## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Create a warm, welcoming digital experience that balances playful elements appealing to children with the professional trust markers parents and healthcare providers expect. The interface should immediately communicate safety, expertise, and accessibility while reducing anxiety for families in crisis. Every interaction should feel supportive, with clear pathways to help and resources. The design must work seamlessly across devices, recognizing that many parents will access the site during stressful moments on mobile devices.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Progressive Disclosure**: Complex information about services and eligibility criteria will be revealed gradually, preventing overwhelm while ensuring families get complete information when needed.

**Guided Journeys**: The service finder tool will use conversational UI patterns, walking families through decisions step-by-step rather than presenting all options at once.

**Immediate Access**: Critical information (contact numbers, 24/7 availability) will be persistently visible through sticky headers or floating action buttons.

**Emotional Reassurance**: Microcopy and visual cues will provide constant reassurance, using warm language and imagery that conveys "you're in the right place."

**Accessibility-First Interactions**: All interactions will be keyboard navigable, screen reader friendly, and work without JavaScript for maximum inclusivity.

### Core Screens and Views

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

We'll use a monorepo structure to maintain all WordPress theme files, plugins, and configurations in a single repository. This simplifies deployment, version control, and ensures consistency across development environments. The repository will include:
- Custom theme directory
- Custom plugins (if any)
- WordPress configuration files
- Docker setup for local development
- Build tools and scripts
- Documentation

### Service Architecture

**CRITICAL DECISION**: The WordPress site will follow a **Monolithic** architecture as a traditional WordPress installation. This approach is chosen because:
- WordPress is inherently monolithic and works best in this configuration
- Simpler hosting requirements aligning with budget constraints
- Easier maintenance for MUVE's team
- All functionality integrated within WordPress core, themes, and plugins
- Shared hosting compatibility maintained

However, we'll implement modern development practices:
- Modular theme structure with clear separation of concerns
- Component-based CSS/JS architecture
- API-ready implementation for future headless possibilities
- CDN for static asset delivery

### Testing Requirements

**CRITICAL DECISION**: We'll implement a **Unit + Integration** testing approach focused on critical functionality:
- **Unit Tests**: For custom PHP functions, form validations, and data processing
- **Integration Tests**: For plugin interactions, form submissions, and third-party services
- **Visual Regression Tests**: For responsive design and cross-browser compatibility
- **Accessibility Tests**: Automated WCAG compliance checking
- **Performance Tests**: Automated PageSpeed and load time monitoring
- **Manual Testing Checklist**: For user journeys and edge cases

Testing tools:
- PHPUnit for WordPress unit tests
- Cypress for E2E testing of critical paths
- Pa11y for accessibility testing
- Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

• **WordPress Version**: Latest stable release (6.8+) with automatic security updates enabled

• **PHP Configuration**: PHP 8.3+ with OPcache enabled, memory_limit at 256M minimum

• **Database**: MySQL 8.0+ with InnoDB storage engine, regular optimization schedules

• **Development Workflow**: Git-based version control, feature branches, staging environment for testing

• **Build Process**: Webpack for asset compilation, npm scripts for automation, CSS preprocessor (SASS)

• **Caching Strategy**: Object caching with Redis/Memcached, page caching via plugin, browser caching headers

• **Security Measures**: Web Application Firewall (WAF), regular security scanning, principle of least privilege

• **Plugin Philosophy**: Prefer established, well-maintained plugins over custom development where possible

• **Custom Development**: Limited to theme customization and specific feature requirements not met by plugins

• **API Considerations**: RESTful API endpoints for future mobile app or external integrations

• **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated deployment from Git to staging/production via CI/CD

• **Monitoring Stack**: Uptime monitoring, error logging, performance metrics dashboard

• **Backup Strategy**: Daily automated backups with 30-day retention, tested restore procedures

• **Local Development**: Docker-based environment matching production PHP/MySQL versions

• **Code Standards**: WordPress Coding Standards enforced via PHPCS, modern JavaScript (ES6+)

• **Asset Optimization**: Image optimization pipeline, lazy loading, critical CSS inlining

• **Email Infrastructure**: SMTP service integration (SendGrid/Mailgun) for reliable delivery

• **Analytics Implementation**: Google Tag Manager for flexibility, cookie consent management

• **Third-party Services**: Minimize dependencies but allow for: email service, CDN, monitoring, backups
